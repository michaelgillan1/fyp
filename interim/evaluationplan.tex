\section{Measuring Success}

It is difficult to define success in such a heavily theoretical project. However, there are a number of potential contributions this project could make, and we can evaluate its success on the outcomes of these contributions. Possible contributions we wish to aim for include:

\begin{itemize}
    \item A unified formal model for Pony without generics, that models the largest subset of the Pony language to date. Additionally, a proof of soundness for this model is wanted.
    \item A in-depth investigation into supporting f-bounded polymorphism vs Materials/Shapes in Pony generics. If unsuccessful with the remainder of the project, this investigation can form the basis for future work.
    \item A formal model of generics for Pony that combines our new formal model, and the results of the above investigation. Once we have this model, and ideally a proof of soundness, we can consider implementing this model.
\end{itemize}

Our success at meeting these contributions will allow us to measure how successful this project has been.
