\chapter{Updated Project Plan}

Below is a brief outline of how we intend to proceed with this project from the start of May onwards.

\section{Key Milestones}

\subsection{Genus-}

\textit{\textbf{Time allocated: 1 week} \hfill \textbf{DONE}}

Formal specification to be completed and basis for soundness established. 

\subsection{Proof of Soundness for Genus-}

\textit{\textbf{Time allocated: 1 week} \hfill 27/05}

Once formal specification is complete, proof of soundness will likely require structural induction on operational semantics.

\subsection{Introduction of Deny Capabilities}

\textit{\textbf{Time allocated: 1 week} \hfill 03/06}

Introduce deny capabilities into formal specification. This will require updated syntax, rules for well-formed programs, and operational semantics.

\subsection{Proofs}

\textit{\textbf{Time allocated: 1 weeks} \hfill 10/05}

2 proofs are required: one to ensure the model guarantees data race freedom, and another to show the model is sound.

\subsection{Iterations}

\textit{\textbf{Time allocated: 1 weeks} \hfill 15/06}

Iterate on the model. Potentially introduce novel ideas not yet explored with deny capabilities, such as borrowing, and inference. Introduce models as named concepts to recreate Genus if desired.

\subsection{Evaluation and Write-Up}

\textit{\textbf{Time allocated: 0.5 week} \hfill 17/06}

Write up will be ongoing, some time will be set aside to polish up the report.
